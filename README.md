# orgf
orgf is a CLI tool that helps users to organize their files with ease. It creates folders for different file types, (i.e. images, videos, photos) and move the files to the appropriate folder. orgf can also do this recursively, which means if the `--recursive` file specified the subdirectories will be organized.
