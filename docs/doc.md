# General use of doc

doc (aliases: docs, document, documents) is a command that organizes image files in a subdirectory. The default subdirectory name is `docs`, and the default image file extensions are `.doc`, `.docx`, `.txt`, and `.pdf`. **YOU CANNOT ADJUST OR DELETE ANY OF THE DEFAULT FILE EXTENSIONS.** But you can add more image file extensions if you want to move these files.
