# General use of img

img (aliases: imgs, image, images) is a command that organizes image files in a subdirectory. The default subdirectory name is `imgs`, and the default image file extensions are `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif` and `.svg`. **YOU CANNOT ADJUST OR DELETE ANY OF THE DEFAULT FILE EXTENSIONS.** But you can add more image file extensions if you want to move these files.
